    <h4>1.1 - Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.
      <p>You need the 2 numbers together and if the sum of the 2 numbers is more than the max number allowed in a place, then you do the sum of the 2 numbers minus the max allowed for a single place and put it in that place and carry a 1 over to the next place.
    </h4><br>
    <h4>2.1 - What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?
      <p>Instead of carrying over a 1 when the sum of 2 numbers is greater than or equals 10, you have to carry a 1 over if it equals or is greater than 8.
    </h4><br>
    <h4>3.1 - What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?
      <p>Instead of carrying over a 1 when the sum of 2 numbers is greater than or equals 10, you have to carry a 1 over to the next place if the sum of the 2 numbers equals or is greater than 16. If the sum equals 10, 11, 12, 13 14, or 15, then you use A, B, C, D, and E instead.
	</h4><br>
    <h4>4.1 - What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?
      <p>You have to carry over a 1 to the next place if the sum of the 2 numbers are equal to or greater than 1.
    </h4><br>
    <p>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
      <br>
      The main idea was to learn how to do addition in multiple different bases, such as octal, hexadecimal, and binary.
      <br><br>
      What challeneges did I encounter?
      <br>
      When trying to solve the equations on the M1012, it became a very tedious task and I kept making simple errors when trying to add numbers together.
      <br><br>
      How could this experience be improved?
      <br>
      I don't think it needs to be improved.
      <br><br>
      Free Reflection: How was what I've learned affected my thinking?
      <br>
      I learned how to do additional within bases other than decimal.
