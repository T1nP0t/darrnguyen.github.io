    <h4>1.1 - What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?
      <p>The AND truth table produces the output for the Carry column.
    </p></h4>
      <h4>1.2 - What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?
	<p>The XOR truth table produces the output for the Sum column.
      </p></h4><br>
      <h4>2.1 - What do you notice about the relationship between the first half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?
	<p>The S output for the first half of the Full-Adder table is the same.
      </p></h4>
      <h4>2.2 - Why do you think this is true?
	<p>I believe this is true because there are no Carry Ins for the first half, which would add another bit to the sum of the <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> inputs.
      </p></h4><br>
      <h4>3.1 - Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?
	<p>The least significant bit position uses a half-adder because there is no 3rd bit to add in, so therefore a Carry In is not required.
      </p></h4>
      <h4>3.2 - Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bit in numbers <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. Will the correct output from S be avaiable instantaneously? If not, why not?
	<p>No, because the sum of the inputs from the half-adder have to be considered first, as well as any potential other full-adders.
      </p></h4>
      <h4>3.3 - Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that <i>C</i>15 is high. What can we infer. What is this state commonly called?
	<p>It can be inferred that the number being calculated is higher than the 16 bit integer is. This is called overflow, or the 16 bit integer limit.
      </p></h4><br>

    <p>What did I learn? What was the "big idea"?
      <br>
      I learned how half and full adders worked.
      <br><br>
      What challenges did I encounter?
      <br>
      A challenge I encountered was how the full-adder worked.
      <br><br>
      How could this experience be improved?
      <br>
      I don't think it needs to be improved.
      <br><br>
      Free Reflection: How has this affected my thinking?
      <br>
      I learned how half and full adders worked.
