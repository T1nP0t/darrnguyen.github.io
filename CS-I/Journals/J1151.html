      <h4>1.1 - How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?
        <p>It increases the number of options there are which therefore increases the number of different ways a computer program can run.
      </p></h4>

      <h4>1.2 - Why do you think the term <i>consequent</i> is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the <i>Boolean test</i> evaluates to true?
	<p>Because whenever the boolean value is true, the program will follow down the normal route whereas false will cause it to run an alternative route.
      </p></h4>

      <h4>2.1 - Why is it the first jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be exeucuted or not?
	<p>Because we need to test whether the comparsion is true or not, and this will determine if the program will jump to the alternative option or not.
      </p></h4>

      <h4>2.2 - What is the purpsoe of the Jump instruction after the consequent?
	<p>So it skips the alternative code and does not run it and jumps to the code under the afterAltnerative section.
      </p></h4>

      <h4>2.3 - Why is there no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative?
	<p>Because since the afterAlternative section is after the alternative section, there is no need to jump it because the program will execute whatever line comes next.
      </p></h4>
