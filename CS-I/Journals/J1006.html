      <p> 1.1 - What is Git communicating to you?
      <br>
      Git is telling you that the file has been successfully commited.
      <br><br>
      1.2 - What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?
      <br>
      What I see in common is that they both display the commit message you put in.
      <br><br>
      1.3 - Why do you think this is?
      <br>
      I think they both display the commit message so you can see what notes you put in which could contain helpful instructions.
      <br><br>
      2.1 - What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?
      <br>
      Both file1.txt and file2.txt are displayed in a red text.
      <br><br>
      2.2 - Are both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?
      <br>
      Both file1.txt and file2.txt are displayed within the same section.
      <br><br>
      3.1 - What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?
      <br>
      Both files are now displayed in a green text instead of red text.
      <br><br>
      3.2 - Compare and contrast the manner in which two files are displayed.
      <br>
      Both file1.txt and file2.txt are in a green colored text instead of the red text before. There's no difference between how both of them are displayed other than the file names.
      <br><br>
      4.1 - How many files are listed as been changed?
      <br>
      2 files have been listed as been changed.
      <br><br>
      4.2 - What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?
      <br>
      Any lines removed from files are displayed in red text with a "-" in front, while lines added are in green text with a "+" in front. The most recently edited file is listed first.
      <br><br>
      5.1 - Execute the commands "git diff" and also "git diff --cached". What does Git tell you has changed? Why?
      <br>
      When I type "git diff", I get nothing in response, but when I type in "git diff --cached", I get a list of recent changes to files added to Git. I believe this happens because when you add "--cached", you ask for any changes made anytime in the past.
      <br><br>
      What did I learn? What's "the big idea"?
      <br><br>
      What challenges did I encounter?
      <br><br>
      How could this experience be improved?
