      <b>Technical Challenges - </b> I had some difficulty coming up with flowcharts for my code. <br><br>                    
      <b>Scheduling Challenges - </b> I had a hard time mangaging my work and getting it done because of things that happened this week.  <br><br>

      <b>Technical Challenges - </b>At first, I had a hard time trying to get the CoderMerlin Karel Mission set up, but I eventually learned how to use the IGIS. <br><br>
      <b>Scheduling Challenges - </b> Because of being out last week due to the ice, I have had a hard time trying to get back on track with my work. <br><br>
      <b>Interpesonal Challenges - </b> Nothing much has happened. <br><br>

      <b>Technical Challenges - </b>  When doing the Merlin Missions for the week, I had a hard time concatenating values with different classes, as even though I would turn them both into integers or strings, I still got errors in my code. Eventually I learned that I had to add "!" after the values for it to work properly.<br><br>
      <b>Scheduling Challenges - </b> For this semester, the robotics club moved their meetings from Tuesdays and Thursdays to Mondays and Wednesdays. This has made interfered with my computer science club, which is also on Wednesday, along with complicating picking me up at the Steam Center every Mondays and Wednesdays since I leave much later.<br><br>
      <b>Interpersonal Challenges - </b> My team has not came up with any ideas for the project or talked about it at all. I hope that we could be able to come up with some sort of idea within the next couple weeks.<br><br>

      <b>Technical Challenges - </b> This week, we were required to change our passwords for our school account. However, I encountered many issues when attempting to do so. When initially trying to reset my password, it said that my password did not meet the minimum requirements despite me ensuring that my password did have the requirements. After successfully resetting it, I temporarily lost access to my studfent portal, making it much more difficult to access school-related websites. <br><br>
      <b>Scheduling Challenges - </b> A scheduling challenge I had was adjusting back to school hours after winter break, as I slept late most days during break and woke up late. This soon fixed itself after a couple days of being in school again. Another scheduling problem would be that I would procrastinate a lot on assignments and wouldn't start them until the evening, putting a lot of avoidable stress on me to finish everything before bedtime as I crammed those assignments. <br><br>
      <b> Interpersonal Challenges - </b> I have limited ways to communicate with most of my team mates, which could be a problem when doing the project. Without proper communications, it would be hard to arrange a time where everyone could work on the project, or tell others what has been completed or not.

    <h2>Project Roles</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Software Engineer - </b> A software engineer develops computer systems and applications that can be used to solve real-world problems. This is achieved by writing the program in a large variety of different programming languages, such as Javascript, Python, and C#. This is one of the roles I feel like I could potentially fit in as I have a bit  prior experience and knowledge in Swift and coding in general, but still need to learn the more complex side of this language.<br><br>
      <b>QA Engineer - </b> A QA (Quality Assurance) Engineer tests out software created and tries to catch any bugs in the code. QA Engineers aren't required to have as much knowledge of a programming language as a software engineer should. I feel like this could be a potential role for me as I am usually able to identify what, where, and why errors are occuring. <br><br>
      <b>Project Manager - </b> These people are repsonsible for overseeing the project, planning, organizing, monitoring progress, and managing the team. They would also require good organizing, time management,and communication skills. This wouldn't be a good role for me because although I am relatively organized, I often procrastinate a lot until the last minute, as well as lacking good communication. Splitting the project up into smaller portions and setting deadlines for those portions could help with these problems.<br><br>
      <b>Product Manager - </b> Their job is to identify the needs and wants of consumers via communicating with the consumers along with assisting other people in the project to create a good product for the consumers. This would not be a role for me because of my lack of communcation, marketing, and analytical skills. This could be fixed by communicating more to people and by trying to better understand how businesses work.<br><br>
      <b>Release Engineer - </b> Ensures that the software functions as intended before releasing it. They are also tasked with fixing and updating the software when needed. This could be a role for me with my current knowledge of technology, however I would still need to learn a lot more about coding.
