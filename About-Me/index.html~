    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Darrion Nguyen and I'm curently a sophomore student in Computer Science I.
      <br><br>
      I believe having a digital portfolio is important because it contains all of my current and past projects. I can use this portfolio to show other people such as future employers projects I have done and to display my skills to them.
