    <h4>1.1 - Compare this behavior to that of the <b>while</b> loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?
      
      <p>A <b>while</b> loop tests for the condition before the statement while the <b>repeat-while</b> loop does this after the statement.
	
    </p></h4>
    
    <h4>1.2 - What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute?
      
      <p>The loop will execute the code at minimum one time.
	
    </p></h4>
    
    <h4>1.3 - What is the purpose of the <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>consequent</i>?
      
      <p>The purpose of this jump is to loop back to the statement.
	
    </p></h4>

    <h4>2.1 - Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a <i>while</i> loop using a <i>repeat-while</i> loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.

      <p>No, it is not possible to do this because a while loop test for true or false before the statement, so the loop might not run at all compared to a repeat-while where it will always run at least once.

    </p></h4>

    <h4>2.2 -Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.

      <p>Yes, this can be done by adding an additional statement before the loop begins.

    <p><b>What did I learn? What was the "big idea"?</b>
      
      <br>
      
      The big idea was how repeat-loops work and how they differ from while loops.
      
      <br><br>
      
      <b>What challenges did I encounter?</b>
      
      <br>
      
      I did not experience any challenges in this lesson.
      
      <b>How could this experience be improved?</b>
      
      <br><br>
      
      I don't think anything needs to be changed.
      
      <br><br>
      
      <b>Free Reflection: How has this affected my thinking?</b>
      
      <br>
      
      This helped me better understand when I should use repeat-loops or while-loops.
