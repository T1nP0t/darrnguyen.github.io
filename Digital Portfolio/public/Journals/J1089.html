      <h4>1.1 - Why do you think Hello world is typically the first program taught to students?
	<p>This is because it is simple task to accomplish and lets them begin to learn the basics.
      </p></h4>
      <h4>1.2 - How might Hello World program be different, depending on the programming language it's written in?
	<p>Different languages have different syntax, so depending on the language, you may need to write more or less lines of code.

      <p><b>What did I learn? What was the "big idea"?</b>
	<br>
	I learned that "Hello World" is used to introduce people to the basics of programming.
	<br><br>
	<b>What challenges did I encounter?</b>
	<br>
	Attempting to print Hello World was much more difficult than other languages.
	<br><br>
	<b>How could this experience be improved?</b>
	<br>
	For the mission, I think it's too repetitive to print Hello World in 12 different languages.
	<br><br>
	<b>Free Reflection: How has this affected my thinking?</b>
	<br>
	I learned how to print Hello World in several different languages.
